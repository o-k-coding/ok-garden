Time for another garlic-y update! By the second week of June our happy garlic stems were all laying down, and many of the leaves had begun to yellow or even brown.
This meant it could be about time to harvest! We dug up a couple just to be sure, and sure enough the bulbs were looking nice and full.
The next day we took the time to gently pull them each out of the ground, shake the dirt off and braid them together in groups of six or nine.
We then took the braids and hung them on an old wooden rack we recently bought from an antique mall in Lake Odessa MI and suspended in our garden shed.

We're very excited for the bulbs to finish curing so we can start cooking with them. We use garlic for many things but I am personally most excited for hot sauce when our peppers are ready üå∂Ô∏è
