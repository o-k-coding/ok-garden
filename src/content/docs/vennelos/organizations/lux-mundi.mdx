title: Lux Mundi
description: Organization - Lux Mundi
---
Largest religious organization in Southern Vennelos. They worship the "Original Light" also called the "True Light". Outwardly they tend to many of the religious needs of the population, performing rites of birth, death and marriage. They also provide healing and exorcism services. In some cases they provide military support against so called "agents of the Dark".

They publicly denounce and suppress worship of more traditional "pagan" gods, claiming that all other gods and sources of divine power are merely facets of the Original Light. Lux Prophecy tells of a "Forerunner" who will be the chosen bearer of the original light and will pave the way for enlightenment of all of Vennelos. 

The church is based out of the city state of Lux, positioned at the mouth of the Bay of Light on the Storn peninsula where the Kingdom of Storn rules. 

Though the church does not directly participate in politics, they wield power through influence of leaders. It is well known the queen of Lystara Catherine Lys is a devotee of the Light. Storn however maintains a neutral relationship with Lux as a neighboring city state and interacts with the Church and Lystara only in practical matters.
