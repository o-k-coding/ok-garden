Member of Dug's gang family, pre slavery.

The last time Dug had seen her, they were held in chains in some unknown dungeon. Iris had been disguised as a boy, something she did often to help her avoid notice and unwanted attention when picking pockets. Unfortunately, this also led to the guards deciding to send her to the fighting pits with the other male captives from their gang. She had been badly injured in the capture, and could not walk. The slavers tolerate no laggards and decide to kill "him" slowly with a sword in the stomach. However, when dug relived this memory as a projection of moon magic channeled through Kiki in Sehanine's temple, the more perceptive of the viewers noticed a faint wink and smile from Iris just before the ghostly images faded.

Though she seems bashful about it, it would seem that Sehanine may have given Iris the means to survive that night, and the power to become a young freedom fighter. She now serves as captain of Lyra's liberating force. With a growing reputation on the streets of Vennelos as someone who fights for the people, Iris is bringing voice to the denial and suppressed rage of a populace whose complacency is starting to run thin...
