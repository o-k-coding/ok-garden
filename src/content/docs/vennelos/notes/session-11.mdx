## Arthur Learns Enchanting

Arthur spent some time with Thrin Stoneforge learning how magical enchanting works. She described how magic can have properties almost like "shape" and "color". When a person casts spells they channel magic through themselves, bending and shaping power to achieve the desired result. She demonstrated how a piece of metal makes a good magical energy "storage container" by pushing a spell into it. However, Arthur found it difficult to pull the energy back out. She explained that gemstones allow magic to flow more easily. Sure enough, when a spell was then pushed into the metal through a gemstone, Arthur was able to pull the energy out and use the spell stored in the metal. After this demonstration, Thrin asked Arthur to leave because she had weeks worth of work to do in just a day for the party, and didn't want him to learn her "trade secrets".

## The Cowboy and The Carnie

As he left, he came upon Vee and a small one eyed cat Skrillex that Arthur had seen with the party. Vee worked with the Spectacle of Wonders Circus. They had met a few weeks prior in a town to the west, and travelled together in the circus caravan to Kalenel where they parted ways. Vee revealed that she was working with Lyra and had been sent to aid the party with her infiltration and knife and skills.

Skrillex quickly disappeared in a shadowy alley. Worried about losing the party's trust, Arthur and Vee entered the shadows to try and find him. Luckily he reappeared quickly, though inexplicably behind them. So they made their way from the Artisan district back to the Market district and the White Flame HQ (WF).

## Blueberry Pies

Back at home base, Barnaby, Creel, Dug, Kiki Martha and Kite settled in after a long day in various states of exhaustion and injury.

Taryn, struck by a rare jovial mood, made her grandmother's blueberry pie for the group, revealing that she had been brought into the White Flame's staff as a baker. To a discerning eye, she seemed especially pleased to see Kiki enjoying her pie. It seems that Taryn finds happiness and value in being active and useful...

## Introducing Vee

Soon Arthur and Skrillex arrive at WF. Arthur introduces Vee to the rest of the party. Kite, immediately feeling some competitive kinship, challenges Vee to show off her knife throwing skills, kicking off an escalating competition between Vee, Arthur and Kite to knock an errant fly out of the air with ranged weapons.

## Skrillex the "Tail"

While this happens, Martha learns that Skrillex did indeed follow Lyra. He joined her for a meal, and followed her to some kind of safe house, where she tended to a number of people who had been rescued by her operatives the night prior. Skrillex recounted how she offered them aid to return to their homes in peace, or a place in their fight against the people who enslaved them in the first place. Those that chose to stay and fight were given over to the care of a very young woman with green hair and purple eyes. After this errand, Lyra asked Vee to take Skrillex and find Arthur. She asked Vee to join the party in the coming heist on the Sea Sword. Martha learned that Skrillex knows and trusts Lyra, mentioning that she is a "guardian" like himself. When asked what he guarded, Skrillex responded "well you all I guess". Curious indeed.

## Investigations

Kiki and Kite shared a moment where Kiki channeled the power of the moon goddess to transfer the power of Kite's magical poison dagger into a new tattoo, augmenting his psychic blades with poison effect.

The group spent time investigating the documents they received from the council secretary Peter the perilous pixie as well as a number of items they had found while clearing Melora's temple of demons.

## Revenge of the Fly

Shortly after, Arthur shot a hole in the window of the WF and Kite poked his head out to see if anyone had noticed. While he didn't notice anything outside, it soon became clear that someone noticed them.

## Gnog The Bounty Hunter

Sneaking through the kitchen back door, and bursting through the front door, Gnog the gnoll bounty hunter and his loyal clan of inbred goblins arrived to collect on the parties bounty.

A decisive battle commenced, the tides quickly turning in the parties favor when Taryn landed the killing blow on a thoroughly injured Gnog. Barnaby and Creel even played support, helping dug stuff goblins into the bag of holding, where they quickly dissolved within Cubert's gelatinous flesh devouring form. It became clear the fighting spirit of the goblins was failing, and the party brought a swift and - in some cases - unmerciful end to their pitiful existence.

Before ending the life of the final goblin, the party questioned them to determine if there was anything worthwhile to learn. They gathered that at some point Gnog killed their clan leader and had been leading them in the pursuit of murder and kidnapping for hire. Putting this together with Dug's knowledge that Gnog was a simple - if brutal - bounty hunter, the party decided there was little to be gained from the goblin, and sent them to meet their aunt and uncle-cousins in whichever layer of the hells murderous goblins occupy.

## Midnight Errands

Since Thalorian was gone and had forgotten to arrange for the normal contracted house staff to work while he was away, Creel and Barnaby were put to work cleaning the bodies and various unmentionable fluids left behind by the battle.

At this point it was quite early the next morning and the party had fought two battles since their last sleep. Kiki, Dug, Taryn and Vee retired to the spa/sauna while Arthur left to go get his items from Thrin with Martha tagging along and Kite sneaking rather loudly behind. Along the way, Arthur learned that Thrin had been seen heading north. At some point though he realized that she had asked them to come back later that day and promptly turned, barefoot and bloodied, to head back to WF HQ with Martha and Kite.

Before bed, Arthur spent a bit of time studying the book of necromancy spells, attempting to replicate the techniques Thrin taught him in order to augment in revolver. While unsuccessful, Arthur gained some insight that it could be easier to achieve his goals if he used spells that he was familiar with and could cast with ease, and that to learn the spells from the book, he may need to do some wizardly studying.

After an uneventful and restful night, the party once more joined and decided to spend their day preparing for the heist.

## Where Are the Guards?

Arthur, Kite and Martha made for the Market district guard barracks, which they found almost completely abandoned. Arthur and Kite broke into the armory, finding a number of spears and short swords while Martha distracted the lone grey beard guard who seemed interested only in playing solitaire and complaining about the state of the city.

Martha did learn that the common folk had become quite restless, blaming the councillors, nobles and lux church for the lack of protection from were rats, undead, demons and the disruption of trade. Additionally the Lux were being blamed for the undead presence in the city after finding evidence of undead activity in the market district church. The people had begun to form picket lines outside the wealthy western residential district, where the nobles, lux priesthood and stronger guard companies had all retreated to and barricaded themselves in.

## Stoneforge "Forgeside" Order Pickup

The group then paid a visit to an incredibly tired Thrin to gather their custom made magical wearables. The party questioned if she was "cool" and could be trusted, to which she irately grumbled about working for weeks straight and for a discount in order to help their cause, which no one seemed to react to.

## The Heist Begins

Shortly after the sun set, the party set out for the port district to rendezvous with Lyra's liberators and Kesh's street toughs. At the indicated door, the party followed Lyra's directions more perfectly than Lyra herself likely could have, knocking once and whistling. A voice from within greeted them "it is so late yet I cannot sleep" to which they responded "let the wind lull you". Once inside, they came upon a young girl who seemed to be running the show who turned out to be Iris, the last surviving member of Dug's old gang, who was believed to be dead until very recently. She revealed that she had actually been saved by Sehanine in order to bring justice to the slavers. Perhaps there was a hidden purpose tied to the painful vision Dug had been granted that night in the temple of Sehanine after all. After an emotional reunion, the street toughs arrived, led by Delton, a charismatic old friend of Kite's who really likes to give crushing hugs.

The group then decided how they would approach the boat, dividing duties between an infiltration and distraction team and set out to perform their heist under the cover of a shrouded moon...
