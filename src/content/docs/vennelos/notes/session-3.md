## Active Party Quests

### Mysterious box

Given by Elysia and Lady Elowen Moonshadow of the Elegant Elfresco Eatery In exchange for some guidance on research, and a promise to let them know if the party determines what the box does.

Physical and magical inspection was done

- Small enough to fit in a hand
- Purple circle around a purple butterly
  - The line of the circle shimmers in the light, like water on waves
- Has a button on it, located "above" the butterfly
- On the opposite side of button there is a depression where it seems like this could fit together with something else
- A small "s" inscribed in dwarven below the circle
- "Seek the place where I begin" inscribed in dwarven below the "s"

## To The Docks

Party made their way to the docks in the port district of Kalenel.

Arriving at the docks, Jost disguised himself and talked to a guard patrol of 1 Drow warrior and 2 guards from the Shimmer Cloaks - also known as the Pearl Company - the official guard company of the Port District. The presence of a Drow leading the guards was clocked as odd by those who are familiar with Kalenel.

Jost (and the party) learned this about the buildings:

- small warehouse
  - houses the captains office
- large warehouse
  - guards inside
- leaky tub tavern
  - a group of off duty guards are there

Theobold picked the lock to the large warehouse and the whole party entered.

Looting ensued.

Jost approached the guards in the warehouse (2 Drow, 3 shimmer cloak guards) to try to find more information. Unfortunately they saw through his disguise with a nat 20 perception and attempted to capture him.

The rest of the party got Jost out and proceeded to kill the guards and Drow warriors. More Drow and guards entered the battle in the warehouse including the captain, an elaborately armored Drow woman with dark eyes, dusky blue skin and white hair tied back in a single braid, she wears a circlet with a crescent moon on her brow.

### High points

- Tobias took off a Drows head with a single readied axe blow
- Helix scored first kill
- Great coordination across the party
- Kiki used a readied spell to take down a drow threatening to poison Martha

### Low points

- Dug went down more than once - but hasn't stayed down long
- Party struggling to pull off acrobatics in the dark and disorganized warehouse
- Party was surrounded, fighting on 4 fronts

Session ended mid combat. Party bruised and battered but all are vertical. Drow captain and a single guard remain of their enemies...
