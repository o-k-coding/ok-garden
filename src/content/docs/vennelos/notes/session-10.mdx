## Before Bed

Kite had a conversation with Sehanine about working on using Kiki's connection through the needle of the moon with the magical dagger he has.

## Morning

Arthur woke up to free breakfast of biscuits and gravy.
Lyra gave him the payment chits to trade in at the council chambers for 350 gold each and asked to walk with him to speak to the rest of the party.

When leaving he overheard a guard report - see below for the information that was shared with the group

Martha woke up early and snuck out to try and find Arthur, she gave some breakfast to a little kid running around while looking for directions to the Siren's Song.
She noticed him walking toward the HQ and snuck back in before he arrived.

Creel rearranged all the furniture in the HQ overnight, the new setup looks pretty good!
Kite introduced Creel to coffee.

Barnaby seems to be starting his road to sobriety in misery.

Dug "promoted" Tarin to Lieutenant and put her in charge of whipping Barnaby and Creel into fighting shape by going for a run until Tarin got tired.

## Meeting With Lyra

The party met with Lyra Lullwind who asked if the party would help rescue slaves from the "Sea Sword" and capture the ships captain for 100 platinum (1000 gold) each.
She gave them each an advance of 5 platinum for supplies.

Information she gave them:
- She believes a merchant ship called the "Sea Sword" is the flagship of the slaver fleet and that it will be coming in to port tomorrow night to drop slaves
	-  Ginny Degaul is the owner of the Sea Sword
		- Lyra gave the group a chit to requisition council records for Ginny
- Lyra's agents investigated the other 2 addresses where slaves were sent to after coming into the port. One building was empty, One they were able to save a group of slaves from.
- Lyra told the party information about what has been going on behind the scenes with Captain Lant and his investigation into the slavers
	- Lyra and her allies had determined that Dralk and Thaldar were competing to be the lead slavers in the city
	- Lant confronted Council member Dralk of the market district, attempting to find hard evidence that he was the leader. The confrontation turned violent and Dralk was killed.
	- Lant then arrested Thaldar for possession of a stolen holy symbol of the lux church in the market district
	- Lant was arrested on two charges
		- murder of a council member (dralk)
		- arrest of a council member outside of his jurisdiction, without a proper warrant
	- Once Lant was arrested, the council ordered the crimson cloaks to move Thaldar to the council prison.
	- Thaldar's escort from the artisan district jail to the council prison was attacked. No bodies were found, but there were scorch marks and blood left behind.
- Lyra gave them an address to a building in the port district where they could meet up with her agents before attempting to take the Sea Sword.
	- The party was instructed to go to the north door, knock once then whistle. If a voice says "It is so late yet I cannot sleep" they will respond "Let the wind lull you".

Martha then used speak with animals to ask Skrillex to tail Lyra.

Kite received a few things that had been delivered to marc's tavern
- 3 letters from Pippa and Roger
- A coin from Kesh indicating he wanted to have a peaceful conversation
- A stack of internal edge of night bounty notices for each of the party members, and pippa and roger for 500 gold each.

Martha had a private conversation with Arthur regarding a special request Martha had.

Kite Kiki and Dug got some ice cream for breakfast.

## Death in the Church

The party investigated a crime scene at the Market district Lux church, Arthur fired a gun in the air and dispersed the commoners crowding around.

Martha convinced the guards that she was there from the Lux and they had it under control. The guards gladly and quickly left them to it.

The party entered the church and found the following
- Many people had been killed by slash/piercing weapons, all wearing Lux vestments
- The high priest was found with a hastily scrawled note:
  "Oh light protect us what have we done? What monsters do we unleash upon this world. Oh the folly of human kind that we believed we could control the spirits of the dead."
	- It seemed like the note might have been planted with the intent of pointing to the lux church as being behind the necromancy in the city
- The high priest was disfigured by slashes on the face, but it seemed like he was actually strangled to death by his holy symbol, an amulet
	- Kite recognized that the amulet was something he had been contracted to plant on on Thaldar (Councilor of the banking district), which led to his arrest by captain Lant.
	- Martha noted that the holy symbol was not the right quality for the high priests rank.
- There were no signs of forced entry into the church
- The violence seemed to have originated from inside the church, specifically from a hallway where Arthur found a holding cell that had been blown open from the inside.

When Martha picked up the high priests holy symbol to get a closer look, a powerful wraith appeared, and several of the dead bodies rose as zombies.

Like true professionals, our party began systematically dispatching the undead interlopers. The battle seemed to be going well until Dug's soul was nearly drained from his body in one swipe of the wraith's ethereal claws. The fiery rage of a true berserker kept the icy waters of death at bay long enough for Martha to heal dug and incinerate the wraith in a powerful blast of radiant lunar energy.

Shaken, the group decided to leave the church and go about their day. A problem for someone else perhaps.

## Downtime Activities

Kite had a conversation with Kesh where Kesh asked if Kite could capture the captain of the "Sea Sword"
- His reward would be the removal of the parties bounties, and immunity for him from the Edge of Night.
- Kesh offered the help of some street toughs that are not directly in the Edge of Night, just asked Kite to let him know where to send them.
- Kesh let Kite know that his sources reported Pippa and Roger as being on board the Sea Sword as captives.
- Kesh handed Kite a bag of spices that clinked subtly as if there was some metal within.

Cue shopping montage
- Kiki bought a dress from a gnome tailor
- The party bought some magical foods from the Elegant Elfresco
- Arthur sold his demon head to a taxidermist for 500 gold
	- Met a guy trying to find a halfling bard that promised him gold for the pelt
- Party went to the council building to get their payment for closing the demon portal
- Kite swapped a music box with a homemade token of Sehanine at a trinket vendor
- The whole party went to see Thrin the dwarven armor smith and wearables enchanter
	- Kite ordered an enchantment on his mask that allowed him to use illusion magics to disguise himself at will.
	- Martha asked for her to investigate the priests corrupted holy symbol
	- Martha gave thrin the components needed to fashion a wearable that could hold the power of a sustained spell.
	- Arthur figured out Thrin would buy his demon head for 1500 gold so he ran back, a nat 20 allowed him to thoroughly convince the taxidermist the head was cursed, allowing Arthur to get the head back and "keep his cursed gold"
	- Arthur ordered
		- an enchantment on his  that could blow his hair back for dramatic effect
		- an enchantment on his boots that allow him to magically move a short distance
- The party stopped at Zara's magical items stall to buy some scrolls and potions
	- Zara's guard captain asked Kite about the stolen items, he told them to come by their place later to pick them up.

The party made their way back to the White Flame HQ as the sun was starting to set. Except Arthur, who decided to stay back and watch Thrin work on the enchantments.

Kite sent word to Kesh that they did want the street toughs and that he would follow up on where to send them.

Kite determined that he could connect his mind to the acidic gel residing in the bag of holding. He learned:
- the gel's name is Cubert
- Cubert is not very smart
- Cubert likes to eat meat
- there's a LOT of bones in the bag according to Cubert - which he's not happy about.
