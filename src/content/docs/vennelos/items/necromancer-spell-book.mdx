description: Item - Necromancer Spell Book

A thick black book with a silver skull embossed on the front.
The forward contains chilling words that catch your eye:

```
Long have the wings of necromancy been clipped since the binding of the seven, but no longer. Broken from Hood's Icy grip by a hand that once imprisoned him, the lord of bones now stalks among the living once more. With the return of our patron, we rejoice in the power available to us. Together we will bring dusty forgotten civilizations back to life once more so that we might deliver all the living into the eternal sepulcher of Myrkul. Take heed, budding necromancer, of the words within, for they will guide you on your journey to enlightenment.

- Chandra, Voice of Myrkul, Courtesan of lies, Reaper of souls
```
Inside you find pages describing various necromancy spells with illustrations. You see cramped notes scrawled in the margins. It's clear someone was learning from this. 

Could be used by a wizard to transcribe necromancy spells into their spell book or onto a spell scroll.

If used as a spell casting focus, adds +1 to necromancy spell attacks and spell save DC and doubles the time a spell lasts for if it is not instant.
