No names are given, but there is mention that the chosen representatives will be allowed to expense lodging in the town of Dewbridge.


DC 20 investigation

a guard report from 70 years ago about a civil disruption in an east residential cemetery.  It describes a group of people found "attempting to disturb the peaceful slumber of those poor souls". There's little of substance to the report other than an "expert account" from a lux priest, but apparently all of the people were imprisoned and eventually hung for participating in "cult activities".

the report mentions a human woman with curly red hair pale yellow eyes and freckles as one of the apprehended and executed cultists
