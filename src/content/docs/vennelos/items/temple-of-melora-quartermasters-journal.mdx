title: Temple of Melora Quartermaster's Journal
description: Item - Temple of Melora Quartermaster&#39;s Journal
---
An old stained and partially charred journal. You can just make out the faded remains of a gold lightning bolt embossed on the spine. Most is unreadable, or mention the tedium of maintenance and accounting of the temples resources. But a few entries in the journal catch your eye.

Written in modern dwarvish.

```
We need to figure out how to stabilize the flow of power through the conduit.
The current materials will only last so long before breaking down, and they are intensely difficult to fit into place in the right orientation.

I've been reading about researchers using gemstones and crystals to enhance the flow of magical energy and using stone and metal for storage of energy. This might be why our traditional metal conduit doesn't work as well...
```

```
Our shadow conflict with the Lux Mundi continues. We thought kicking the Lystarans back to their corner of the continent would have brought some peace, but the city is overrun with their agents. Despite our best effors, their work is making it difficult to reintroduce worship of Melora.
```

```
Success! We've been able to secure some crystal from Battar and have supplemented almost all of the metal conduit with our new crystal version. It seems to have made everything much more stable. Just as their instructions said. I guess marrying off the princess to that prince from the Kingdom of Are√±l has paid off.

We've installed a trapped set of nodes at the entrance in order to be able to keep out potential intruders.

Several acolytes have disappeared recently, we're worried that the net is closing in.
```

```
We found a face changer among our ranks. They replaced acolyte Dolin, Storm Mother knows what they did to him. They made a mistake though by trying to use the pool of divination. The disturbance of power was felt by all the high priests in the temple, and we were able to apprehend them. They carried a Lux amulet...

The rest of the page is damaged too much to read, and several pages are missing after this one.
```

```
Though we still can't get any information out of them, it's clear the Lux spy did more damage than we thought. Sister Zaggath used the divination pool yesterday, and whatever she saw drove her insane. We had to put her in a magically induced trance to end her ravings.

I inspected the pool and attempted a powerful cleansing ritual, but whatever they did resists our power. I've never felt so drained after a ritual. We've forbidden use of the pool until we can bring a divination wizard from the university to help dispel the the taint.
```

```
The wizard arrived today, all smiles and. Of course she's an elf so what do you expect, but if she can help then that's all I care about.

those are the last words in the journal.
