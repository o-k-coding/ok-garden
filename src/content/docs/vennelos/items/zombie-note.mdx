title: Zombie Note
description: Item - Zombie Note

This note was found on the body of a singular zombie locked in a room deep in the tunnels leading to the temple of Malora beneath Kalenel. It is written in a slight variation of thieves cant that Kite is able to translate given a little time to study it.

They wear masks and black robes. Each bears a ring with this sigil (you see a drawing of a flaming rock streaking over the edge of night sigil). Obviously they are the ones in charge of the slaving, but it seems this is only a small part of their plan. There are four I know of. 

"The Slaver"
Tall and well built, moves like a sword fighter.
Wears a mask depicting a great storm of chains falling from the heavens.

Leads the fleet of merchant vessels that smuggle captives into the city to be sold. At night, the secret cargo is exchanged for heavy crates. I often see one or more of the others at these exchanges.

I recently overheard that they are seeking the aid of a clan of Kuo Toa living in a cave system near the eastern coast of the bay of pearls. They will entice the clan by promising the return of the Prince of Lies to aid their precious Sea Queen.

"The Reaper"
Average height and slight build. Wears the grinning skull of death as a mask.

Works to gather fresh corpses and old bones. They have allied with a clan of wererats in the warrens to help achieve this goal. The grim harvest is always loaded onto the disguised merchant vessels. Recently they mentioned a new opportunity to bind the arch demon "Lord Loss" to their will. They plan to use his lesser demons to harvest massive amounts of bodies and destabilize the city's defenses.

"The Investor"
Quite short and thick. Wears a mask of gold, mottled with grey, its surface fractured by jagged lines of brilliant blue.

It's not clear what the "Investor" does, but I get the impression that they bring powerful connections and resources to the group. When I have spotted them at a shipment exchange, they bring crates of fresh weapons, tools and supplies.

I haven't seen the investor in a few days, it could be because some plans are beginning to unfold.

"The Priest"
Seems to be quite tall, but with the stooped shoulders of an elder.
Wears a porcelain smooth white mask emblazoned with black flames.

This one radiates the presence of a religious zealot, and I can't help but comment on the similarity of their mask to the imagery associated with the lux "White Flame" prophecy. I am curious if it is another reference to the Prince of Lies, Cyric.

They are seen the least of the group. But recently I caught a conversation where they mentioned a change of plans. Things are going to get very chaotic for the population of Kalenel. First they need to sow seeds of suspicion, then they would make for a rendezvous point along the Violet river to await the next phase of the plan.

My most pressing concern is the demons. "The Reaper" has another errand at the "dig site", but will proceed with the ritual upon their return. I will try to find their lair under the city before it begins.

(at the bottom is another edge of night sigil, this one with what looks like ash or stars raining down from the curved daggers)
