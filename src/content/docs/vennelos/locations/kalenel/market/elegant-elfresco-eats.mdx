description: Shop - Elegant Elfresco Eats

This elegant eatery sits right in the midst of the Kalenel central market. It looks like a wagon with a straight up house on top. But there doesn't appear to be any way to attach the wagon to any sort of beast that could pull it along. Windows glow with a cozy warm light, and smoke puffs out of a chimney in regular clouds. If you watch them long enough, it almost seems like you're watching some elegant play.

In front of the house wagon are a few scattered tables and a bar. There are a often a handful of people sitting at the tables enjoying some food and beverages, talking or playing games to pass the time.

Owners:

[[Elysia Moonshadow]]
 A bored looking half orc half elf woman with corn rows, pale green skin and silvery eyes. Wears practical clothing and is often found reading a thick book on artificing or spell casting. Possibly the shortest half orc you've ever met, but still taller than the average human.
 
[[Lady Elowen Moonshadow]]
A scatterbrained high elf woman with disheveled blonde hair and silvery eyes. She's a little short and a little plump for a high elf and wears a lacy apron, though doesn't actually seem to cook anything. Looks the same age as her daughter Elysia.
