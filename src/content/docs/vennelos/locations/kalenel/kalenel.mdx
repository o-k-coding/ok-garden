title: Kalenel
description: Kalenel
---
Neutral trade city situated between the southern kingdoms and the equatorial mountain range. It is the largest port in the southern continent with direct access to the ocean through the Bay of Pearls, and close access to the inland river system.

The city is an irregular circle surrounded by a tall curtain wall. Inside the city is a maze of streets, waterways and buildings arranged in nine unique districts, and a tenth administration district where bureaucracy resides.

Kalenel is ruled by a council of 9 representatives, each from one of the districts.

Each district is policed by a guard company paid for by the common council treasury. Officers are appointed by the councillor for that district, subject to approval by at least one other council member.

Guard companies are named after a precious gem or mineral, which indicates the color of their uniforms. Each company has a unique reputation which has earned each a colloquial name used by commoners.
