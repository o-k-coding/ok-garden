Wayside is a frontier town south of the Equatorial Range positioned right at the Mosaic/Sol rivers confluence.

The town acts as a common rest and resupply stop for adventurers traveling too and from the frontier regions as well as traders moving up and down the Sol river between the two kingdoms of Southern Vennelos - Lystara in the west and Storn in the east.

Skilled adventurers in need of extra coin can take advantage of a relative abundance of work available dealing with the problems that come from being so close to the dangerous frontier wilderness.

Wayside has become a common stopping point for soldiers moving to and from the Southern Kingdoms Army (SKA) Fortification in the eastern foothills of the equatorial range.
The army stages military operations against "the enemy" in the mountains.
The town is home to a permanent garrison for SKA soldiers with a small contingent of auxiliary support staff to support the needs of traveling companies. This newer source of traffic (and coin) has brought new life into the small town, driving growth of many enterprises that profit from war and it's many actors.

## North

There is a goblin settlement across the Sol in the hills that eventually lead to the mountains. It sits along the west bank of the Mosaic and is called Ceyozete, which translates roughly to "Rock Piss" in common. The goblins don't interact much with Wayside.

## South

The Road of Light, originally built by the Kingdom of Lystara and maintained through mutual cooperation of the jurisdictions it runs through.

## East

A well maintained stone bridge spans across the Sol.
Past the bridge is a forest swamp where a group of rangers have a camp.
They keep to themselves for the most part, but will occasionally work with the local authorities for a hefty price.

## West

Along the south bank of the Sol is abundant farmland.
