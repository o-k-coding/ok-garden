title: Mosaic River
description: Location - Mosaic River
---
River that carries runoff from the equatorial mountain ranges. The crystal clear snowmelt allows one to see clearly through to the bottom in most places. Closer to the mountains, the riverbed and banks are covered in myriad pieces of frosted colored glass weathered into rough pebbles nearly half a meter in depth at some points. This beautiful wonder is where the river gained it's name. No one knows for sure where the glass originated, but it is a subject of debate and research by historians across the continent. The most popular claim is that they are the tears of a rainbow dragon that lost it's mate and children to a drow raiding party that were looking to claim them as mounts that they might use them to rain destruction on surface dwellers. 

During dry cool autumns the Mosaic can run almost completely dry in shallower portions, especially near the confluence where the river runs over a short waterfall into the Sol river.
