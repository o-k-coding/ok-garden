The Sol river is a slow moving river that originates from the Bay of light in the east of southern Vennelos and runs west then south, eventually emptying into the Seal of Pearls.

It has two confluences with rivers running south out of the Equatorial mountain range. One with the Mosaic River near Wayside and another with the Spijl River. The Sol also has two branches into distributaries. One that splits into the Violet River which runs into the Bay of Pearls near Kalenel. Another that splits into the Desech river which ends at the land locked city of Desech.
