A world in the material plane. The planet has a single moon and is positioned between two stars. The land mass is mainly made of a single mega continent called Vennelos by it's inhabitants.

The equatorial divide mountain range cuts through the middle of the continent. The treacherous terrain and extreme weather in the range makes travel between northern and southern Vennelos nearly impossible. Most people in Southern Vennelos do not believe there is anything beyond the mountains. Some people (mainly Tabaxi) claim to be from Northern Vennelos, they are generally discredited by most common folk.
